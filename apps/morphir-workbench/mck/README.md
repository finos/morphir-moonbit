# Workbench MCK adapter

This component exposes the shipped `finos/morphir-execution` value codec and
validator to the shared Rust MCK. It supports exact contracts
`0.1.0-draft.1`, `0.1.0-draft.2`, `0.1.0-draft.3` and `0.1.0-draft.4`. It has no goldens, evaluator or separate
conformance runner. The parent `finos/morphir` repository owns the specification,
corpora and verdict calculation. Draft.1/.2 are merged; draft.3 adds invocation
admission; draft.4 adds output admission on the current continuation.

`protocol.mbt` handles capabilities and `decode-value`, echoes correlation IDs
and rejects unknown/duplicate JSON members. Draft.1 capabilities and its original
64-case corpus remain unchanged. JSON calls `Value::from_json`; Ion text calls
the Ion parser and `Value::from_ion`. Both return `Value::to_json`, preserving
exact numbers, Float64 bits and UTF-16 units. Successful decode of a model error
is an outcome projection, without argument admission.

Draft.2 also supports `validate-value` in both formats. Its `input` has exactly
`value`, `type` and `definitions`. `value` is tagged JSON or a single Ion text
value according to `format`. The type and registry use JSON descriptors matching
`ValueType::to_json` and the generated constructor definitions:

```json
{"value":{"type":"int","value":"9007199254740993"},
 "type":{"type":"int"},"definitions":[]}
```

`admission.mbt` parses closed declarations before decoding the value and calling
the shipped `validate_as`. Every custom owner referenced anywhere in the graph
must be declared, including dormant Maybe/Result branches and unused definitions.
Named recursion is allowed without expanding declarations. Function types are
rejected throughout the graph. Record-field, definition and constructor names
must be unique within their containing declaration. A top-level model error is
forbidden as an argument; ordinary `Result.Err` values remain admissible.
Successful admission returns the canonical value projection, without evaluation.

Draft.3 retains both value operations and adds `validate-invocations`. Its input
is exactly `{suite,manifest}`. `suite` is the existing `morphir-invocations-v1`
JSON object or one Ion text string. `manifest` is exactly `{entries,definitions}`;
entries are `{name,inputs,output}` and definitions use the draft.2 shape.
The supplied entries form a public/supported allowlist. This tests membership
against that list, without inferring hidden declarations or model visibility.

```json
{"suite":{"profile":"morphir-invocations-v1","calls":[
  {"id":"c","entry":"identity","arguments":[{"type":"int","value":"007"}]}
]},"manifest":{"entries":[
  {"name":"identity","inputs":[{"type":"int"}],"output":{"type":"int"}}
],"definitions":[]}}
```

Every entry input/output and unused registry declaration is admitted before
suite decoding. Duplicate entry names and malformed manifest shapes use
`workbench.invalid_manifest`. There are at most 1,000 entries, 64 inputs per
entry and 1–1,024 UTF-16 units per name. Entry nodes share the declaration budget.
The adapter then uses the shipped Suite codec and shared `validate_invocations`,
also used by the engine. Missing entries return
`execution.entry_not_public_or_supported`; arity returns `execution.wrong_arity`.
Argument errors retain the existing typed validation codes.

Success contains the canonical `Suite::to_json` under `value`, preserving ordered
calls/arguments and JSON extension bytes. Calls retain shipped identity, arity,
value and extension limits. The parent compares records by field name but keeps
call and argument order. Tiny Ion extension fixtures specify their binary
projections; this is not general Ion binary or reverse-encoding qualification.

The complete compact input envelope is limited to 1 MiB of UTF-8 JSON. Type
parsing allows depth 64 and 10,000 aggregate nodes, counting type descriptors,
record-field descriptors, registry definitions and constructors. Registries allow
256 definitions, 256 constructors per definition and 64 inputs per constructor;
tuples and records allow 1,024 entries. Identities allow 1–1,024 UTF-16 units.
Value codec/type validation retains its separate existing budgets. The wire's
127-container JSON framing limit can be stricter than logical type depth.

Malformed declarations use `workbench.invalid_type` or
`workbench.invalid_definitions`; declaration budget violations use
`workbench.type_limit`; excess input bytes use `workbench.input_limit`.
Unresolved custom references and function boundaries use the existing
`execution.unresolved_custom_type` and `execution.boundary_function` codes.
Execution diagnostics retain only the code before the first colon. Malformed
Ion uses `workbench.invalid_ion`. Exit closes stdout without an observation.
Node/native launchers bound input lines at 2 MiB; the parent owns deadlines,
process supervision and report rechecking.

From the repository root, select a built parent runner and its offline corpus:

```sh
MORPHIR_MCK_BIN=/path/to/finos/morphir/target/debug/morphir \
MORPHIR_WORKBENCH_KIT=/path/to/finos/morphir/spec/workbench/mck/draft.3 \
mise run test:workbench-mck
```

Choose `spec/workbench/mck` or `spec/workbench/mck/draft.2` to requalify the unchanged
earlier corpora. The gate
builds Node/native debug and release adapters, rechecks every saved report through
the parent command and writes evidence beneath `.dev/workbench-mck/`. Pure
protocol tests run on JS, native, Wasm and Wasm GC. No upstream checkout, model or
toolchain is downloaded. Full outcomes envelopes, evaluation, SDK comparison,
general Ion binary or reverse encoding remain separate work. These offline
operations advertise no connected-host protocol extension.

## Declared output admission

Exact draft.4 adds `validate-output` with the same closed `value`, `type` and
`definitions` input as `validate-value`. Complete declaration admission precedes
decoding, then the shipped `validate_as(output=true)` checks returned values.
Only the five recognized top-level SDK model errors bypass ordinary type matching.
Typed `Result.Err` must match its declared error type; nested model errors and
provider/cancellation/cleanup codes reject. Argument admission remains unchanged.
The new operation is unavailable under earlier drafts. The parent owns independent
goldens, corpus inventory and report rechecking; no connected RPC is advertised.
Select `spec/workbench/mck/draft.4` with the existing gate to qualify this draft.
Full outcomes envelopes and lifecycle/cleanup qualification remain separate.
