# Embedded MoonBit tooling

`@morphir/moonbit-toolchain` embeds the pinned MoonBit package compiler and a Wasm
execution adapter in browser and non-browser applications. It requires no system
MoonBit installation or Morphir CLI. Morphir owns these host adapters;
`finos/morphir` has its own Rust CLI and separate integration work.

```js
import {createNodeToolchain} from '@morphir/moonbit-toolchain/node';

const tools = createNodeToolchain();
try {
  const compiled = await tools.request({
    operation: 'compile',
    package: 'example/math',
    files: [['math.mbt', 'pub fn answer() -> Int { 42 }']],
    target: 'wasm',
    exports: ['answer'],
  });
  if (!compiled.successful) throw new Error(JSON.stringify(compiled.diagnostics));
  const result = await tools.request({
    operation: 'run', artifact: compiled.artifact, export: 'answer',
  });
  console.log(result.value); // 42
} finally {
  tools.dispose();
}
```

For browsers, import `createBrowserToolchain` from the `./browser` export. Serve
the packaged `dist/browser-worker.js` as a module worker; bundler users can pass
its resolved URL as `workerURL`. The worker is compiled ahead of time and does
not use runtime `eval`. Each compiler invocation has isolated state, preventing
failed diagnostics from leaking into later compilations.

## Host contract

Providers describe `protocolVersion`, `mode`, supported `operations` and `targets`.
The embedded provider supports `info`, `compile` and `run` for `wasm` and `wasm-gc`.
The process provider in the MoonBit `morphir-host/toolchain` package implements
the same request boundary and adds `setup`, `build` and `exec`. Its compile
operation builds an on-disk project; the embedded operation builds in-memory
packages. Choose a provider by its capabilities.

The JS API is asynchronous and transports binary assets as `Uint8Array`. The
MoonBit host boundary is synchronous and uses JSON. Hosts bridging these APIs
must schedule asynchronous work and encode binary assets or use host-owned
handles explicitly; a worker is not implicitly blocked inside the synchronous
engine. Both APIs expose the same operation/capability vocabulary.

Compilation returns diagnostics, an artifact containing `Uint8Array` Wasm bytes,
the package interface and core. Hosts provide dependency interfaces through
`interfaces`, `indirectInterfaces` and `standardInterfaces`, as `[name, bytes]`
pairs, and linked dependencies through `cores`. The compiler and these assets
must match the pinned revision. This package does not implement `moon`'s package
resolver or build graph; callers compile and link their dependency graph explicitly.

For execution imports, use `createInProcessToolchain({imports})` from `./node`,
or inject a compiler factory with `createEmbeddedToolchain(factory, {imports})`
from the root export. The root module has no Node imports or asset downloads.
The factory returns a fresh compiler exposing `buildPackage` and `linkCore`.
Hosts can supply their own workers with `createWorkerToolchain(worker)` and
configure runtime imports inside those workers. JavaScript functions cannot be
transferred through `postMessage`; built-in workers accept cloneable requests.

Worker requests accept `{signal}`. Cancellation terminates the worker and rejects
every outstanding request; create a new provider to resume. `dispose()` does the
same cleanup. Workers can interrupt synchronous compilation and running Wasm.
In-process cancellation checks between stages; it cannot interrupt synchronous
compiler or Wasm execution. User-defined executable code should run in a worker
with the host's limits and import policy.

## Pin and tests

The adapter pins `@moonbit/moonc-worker@0.1.202609203`, compiler revision
`0.10.14+7d59c7ec9`. Compiler APIs are defined by the
[MoonBit worker package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moonbit/moonc-worker).
The [upstream toolchain documentation](https://www.moonbitlang.com/blog/moonbit-wasm-toolchain)
also describes matching compiler/core versions.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
npm exec -- playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
```

Tests compile real source and execute it in Node and Chromium, report type errors,
recover after failed compilations, supply host imports, and cancel running workers.
The browser fixture demonstrates a host with no CLI. Node demonstrates general
application embedding. `npm test` also checks the installed package.
